In order to understand the secret algorithm, I modified it so that it would be
easier to find a vulnerability. With the help of the modified version, I noticed
the bits of the key being leaked into the hashes, as a bit swap.

To take advantage of that, I calculated the mean of the bits on the same
position and their standard deviation. However, I didn't get anything useful,
as I was expecting the key to be ASCII.

In order to check my algorithm, I created my own sets of hashes and with my
algorithm I obtained the key for them. Knowing that the algorithm is correct,
I came back to the given hashes and checked the decryption of the ciphertext in
AES for all the possible keys, even though they weren't ASCII.

It took a bit of playing with the mean and stdev, but finally I got the key and
the flag:
Key:    0x857db43d95c9db3160c9b83b218fef6b
Flag:   CRYPTO_CTF{01234Hallelujah01234}
