As the encrpytion algorithm is using the non cryptographically secure 'random'
module that is based on Mersenne Twister, I used the randcrack module in order
to determine the key bytes that were used to encrypt the key part of the
plaintext. As the  first part of the laintext was given by the user, I could
easily determine the first 624 * 4 bytes and thus determine the next ones.

Decrypting with the predicted key gave me the flag:
CRYPTO_CTF{7h3y-54y-r4nd0m-15-n07-50-532ur3}
